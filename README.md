"This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow."
I graduated from UofL, May 2025, with a masters in HR & Organizational Development and currently am looking for a full time job. I have managed national and international teams ranging from 2 to over 100 people.  Love to travel and have been to quite a few countries; my favorite being Ireland.
